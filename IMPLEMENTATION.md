# Lumio AI Implementation Guide

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation process for building out the complete Lumio AI platform according to the specification.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current Implementation)

### ✅ Basic Firebase Authentication

- Firebase auth setup for Google and email/password login
- User session management
- Protected routes

### ✅ Chat Interface

- Basic chat UI implementation
- Message history display
- Simple AI response simulation

### ✅ UI Framework

- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Modern UI components
- Animation with Framer Motion

## Phase 2: AI Feature Implementation

### OpenAI Integration

1. Set up OpenAI API credentials in `.env`
2. Implement the Chat service with GPT-4o
   - Replace mock responses with actual API calls
   - Add conversation history tracking
   - Implement streaming for real-time responses

### Memory System with Pinecone

1. Set up Pinecone account and create index
2. Implement vector embedding storage
   - Store conversation history as embeddings
   - Enable semantic search for context retrieval
   - Add user preference tracking

### Media Generation

1. Implement DALL-E 3 image generation

   - Create image generation UI in the Chat interface
   - Add prompt templates for better results
   - Implement image storage and retrieval

2. Implement video generation (Replicate API)
   - Add video generation UI
   - Integrate with Replicate for Stable Video Diffusion
   - Implement video storage and playback

### Voice Interaction

1. Add Speech-to-Text with Whisper

   - Implement audio recording in the browser
   - Send audio to Whisper API
   - Display transcription in chat

2. Add Text-to-Speech
   - Implement TTS API integration
   - Add voice selection options
   - Create audio player component

## Phase 3: Creative Tools

### Canvas Drawing

1. Implement Fabric.js or Konva drawing canvas
2. Add AI-guided drawing suggestions
3. Create drawing prompt generator

### Storytelling Features

1. Build story continuation UI
2. Implement narrative template system
3. Create collaborative storytelling workflow

### Mini-Games

1. Implement simple stress-relief games
   - Breathing visualization
   - Click-to-pop bubbles
2. Add Phaser.js for more complex games

## Phase 4: Recommendation Engine

1. Set up TMDB API integration
2. Implement content recommendation system

   - Store user preferences
   - Generate embeddings for content
   - Use similarity search for recommendations

3. Create feedback collection system
   - Track user ratings and interactions
   - Refine recommendations based on feedback

## Phase 5: Database Architecture

1. Implement PostgreSQL for structured data

   - User profiles
   - Usage metrics
   - Content metadata

2. Set up Redis for caching

   - Session management
   - Rate limiting
   - Temporary data storage

3. Configure S3 or equivalent for media storage
   - Image uploads
   - Generated content
   - User assets

## Phase 6: DevOps & Deployment

1. Containerize with Docker

   - Create Docker Compose for development
   - Build production Docker images

2. Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

   - Automated testing
   - Build processes
   - Deployment pipelines

3. Deploy frontend to Vercel
4. Deploy backend services to AWS or DigitalOcean

## Phase 7: Analytics & Monitoring

1. Implement error tracking with Sentry
2. Set up Prometheus + Grafana for performance monitoring
3. Add usage analytics for feature optimization

## Getting Started With Implementation

To begin working on the next phase:

1. Complete all items in Phase 1 (current implementation)
2. Set up your API keys in the `.env` file
3. Start with the OpenAI integration:

   - Update the Chat component to use the AI service
   - Implement proper conversation handling
   - Add streaming responses

4. Then move on to implementing the creative tools one by one
